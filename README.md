# Algos

This provides a simple framework to use to implement basic algorithms. Node JS is single-threaded, we
can build efficient software to compensate.


## Usage

### SimulatedAnnealing

When you have an problem that can't be solved for large data sets, we need some way to get to a 'good enough'
solution. After all salesmen need to travel today!

[Detailed documentation][SimulatedAnnealing.md]

### Backtracking
 
When the only way to find the answer seems to be by brute force: look at this. Some of the brute
force answers (avenues) just can't work. By shutting them off early - impossible becomes easy.

###Graphs

When you have list of things that are related to one another - this provides a simple framework
to borrow algorithms that have been built up over many years.

## Examples

Look at tests/tests.js for some examples
